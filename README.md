# Questions to be Answered
Why a particular browser is more prefered to the others.

Which of the browsers will be good for market production.

Find out the percentage of request made over a given period(in this case within a month).

# Tool for Analysis
The R studio will be used to extract these information to answer my questions.

#Final Project Files
Within the final project files I have a word document which contains graphs of my explored dataset.
I used excel and the transpose function in R to clean my dataset to suit my exploration.Included also is an additional three dataset of periodic usage of browsers for year 2013,2014 and 2015.This gave me a clearer picture and idea of the browser that is mostly used by users and the best for market production.
